## Project Overview

This repository contains implementations of various regression techniques, focusing on vectorization and feature engineering. Below is a brief overview of each file:

### 1. Multiple_Linear_Regression_vectorisation
This script demonstrates the application of multiple linear regression with a focus on vectorization techniques to improve computational efficiency. It includes a step-by-step implementation using a dataset to predict multiple dependent variables.

### 2. Logistic_Regression_vectorisation
This script implements logistic regression with vectorization to optimize the model's performance. It includes preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation, making it suitable for binary classification tasks.

### 3. Polynomial_Regression_Feature_Engineering
This script explores polynomial regression by applying feature engineering techniques. It demonstrates how to transform input features into polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships between variables, improving model accuracy.
